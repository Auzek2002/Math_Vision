# Math Vision

Math Vision is an interactive application that allows users to solve math problems by drawing on the screen using gestures. The project leverages computer vision techniques and advanced AI models to recognize handwritten mathematical expressions and solve them in real-time.

# Features
1) Gesture-Based Input: Draw math problems directly on the screen using gestures.
2) Real-Time Recognition: Instant recognition of handwritten math expressions using OpenCV.
3) AI-Powered Solution: Solves math problems accurately using Google's Gemini 1.5 model.
